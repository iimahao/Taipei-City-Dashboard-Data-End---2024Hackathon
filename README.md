## Data-End - 2024 Spring Hackathon Edition

This project can be referred to as "Data-End - 2024 Spring Hackathon Edition" and is a small subset of the Taipei City Dashboard data-end.

We have stripped away the system settings and architecture, only providing several indicative data processing examples and corresponding functions. The purpose is to provide data processing examples for teams participating in the "2024 Taipei Spring Coding Festival - Taipei City Dashboard Hackathon."

The complete version of the Taipei City Dashboard data-end utilizes Docker for deployment, uses Airflow for scheduling and monitoring numerous data streams, and stores the data in PostgreSQL for applications.

The complete version of the Data-End will be released soon, with the hope that open data can become your data!

Please refer to the [Doc](https://tuic.gov.taipei/documentation/data-end/dataend) for the quick overview.
