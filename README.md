## Taipei Codefest 2024

Hey! Before you go any further, we would like to invite you to participate in an exciting hackathon event. 

<img width="200" alt="Codefest_Black" src="https://github.com/tpe-doit/Taipei-City-Dashboard/assets/13110501/29ebed08-a63d-4fd5-8bd5-e4c423f4e4d4">

Taipei Codefest is hosted by the Taipei City Government to promote and accelerate the open-source effort of Taipei City Dashboard. Contestants will attempt to create more than 4 new components for Taipei City Dashboard in 32 hours. With a top prize of NT$300,000 and unlimited food during the contest, this is definitely an opportunity you wouldn't want to miss. Check out more information on the hackathon's official site: https://codefest.taipei

## Data-End - Hackathon Edition

This project can be referred to as "Data-End - Hackathon Edition" and is a small subset of the Taipei City Dashboard data-end.

We have stripped away the system settings and architecture, only providing several indicative data processing examples and corresponding functions. The purpose is to provide data processing examples for teams participating in the "2024 Taipei Spring Coding Festival - Taipei City Dashboard Hackathon."

The complete version of the Taipei City Dashboard data-end utilizes Docker for deployment, uses Airflow for scheduling and monitoring numerous data streams, and stores the data in PostgreSQL for applications.

The complete version of the Data-End will be released soon, with the hope that open data can become your data!

Please refer to the [Doc](https://tuic.gov.taipei/documentation/data-end/prerequisites) for the quick start guide.
